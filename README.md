Setting Up the Project
Create Virtual Environment
To start, create a virtual environment to keep the project dependencies isolated.

Open your terminal (PowerShell, Command Prompt, or any terminal of your choice).

Navigate to the project folder.

Run the following command to create a virtual environment:


python -m venv .venv
Activate the virtual environment:

Windows (PowerShell):

.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
Windows (Command Prompt):

.\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

source .venv/bin/activate
Install Dependencies
Once your virtual environment is active, install the required libraries:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Alternatively, install the necessary libraries manually:


pip install google-generativeai python-dotenv
Getting Your Google API Key
To use the Google Gemini API, you'll need to create a project on Google Cloud and obtain an API key.

Go to the Google Cloud Console.
Create a new project.
Navigate to APIs & Services > Credentials.
Under API Keys, click Create credentials and select API Key.
Copy the generated API key.
Add the API Key to the .env File
In the root folder of your project (where your chat.py is), create a file named .env.

Add your API key to the .env file like so:


GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
Make sure to replace your_actual_api_key_here with the API key you got from Google.

Running the Chatbot
Make sure your virtual environment is activated.

Run the Python chatbot script:


python chat.py
Start chatting with the bot! It will ask you for movie/music recommendations, and you can also specify genres, moods, or types of suggestions.

Troubleshooting
Error: "No API_KEY or ADC found."

This means the API key is not being correctly loaded from your .env file. Double-check that your .env file is in the same folder as the script and that the key is formatted correctly.
Ensure you have the python-dotenv package installed and that you're loading it using load_dotenv() in your script.
Virtual Environment Issues

If your virtual environment isn't activating correctly, ensure you're using the correct commands for your operating system (see the "Create Virtual Environment" section).
Example Interaction
ðŸŽ¬ User: "Give me a good sci-fi movie."
ðŸ¤– Bot: "You canâ€™t go wrong with Blade Runner 2049â€”stunning visuals, deep storytelling, and a Hans Zimmer score that hits like a spaceship launch. Or if you want something mind-bending, Interstellar will make you question time itself. Want something lesser-known?"
